Using Henriksen et al 2011 Expimental pain study data (digitized from the 2nd peak KAM plot) had N=35. 
pain levels were ~2.5/10

2nd peak KAM
pain condition = 41.406 (1.75) Nm/kg*100
control = 43.66 (1.715) Nm/kg*100

this gives a simple effect size of 1.35 (cohen's d). 

f = d/2 = 0.675

Based on using an RMD anova with this effect, a=0.05, beta = 0.8, 1 group, 
5 measurements and a (worst case scenario) corr among measures of 0.5...

we need: 4 people.

As we will are examining a larger array out gait outcomes, we will collect 3 times this (n=12).
